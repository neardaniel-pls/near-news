Excellent! Setting up a virtual environment for your Python project in Fedora with VS Code is a great way to keep your project dependencies isolated. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to get you up and running.

### 1. Create a Project Directory and Virtual Environment

First, open your terminal and create a directory for your new project. Then, navigate into that directory and create a virtual environment using Python's built-in `venv` module.

```bash
# Create a directory for your project
mkdir my_project
cd my_project

# Create a virtual environment named '.venv'
python3 -m venv .venv
```

It's a common convention to name the virtual environment directory `.venv` as it keeps the project structure clean and is often automatically recognized by tools like VS Code.

### 2. Activate the Virtual Environment

To use the virtual environment, you need to activate it. This will modify your shell's environment to point to the Python interpreter and packages within your new virtual environment.

```bash
# Activate the virtual environment
source .venv/bin/activate
```

You'll know the environment is active because your terminal prompt will change to show the name of the virtual environment, for example: `(.venv) [user@fedora my_project]$`.

### 3. Open Your Project in VS Code

Now, you can open your project folder in Visual Studio Code.

```bash
# Open the current directory in VS Code
code .
```

### 4. Select the Python Interpreter in VS Code

One of the great features of the official Python extension for VS Code is its ability to automatically detect and use Python environments.

*   **Automatic Detection**: Upon opening the project, VS Code will likely prompt you with a notification asking if you want to use the interpreter in the newly created `.venv` directory. You should select "Yes".
*   **Manual Selection**: If you don't see a prompt or if you need to change the interpreter, you can do so manually:
    1.  Open the **Command Palette**: `Ctrl+Shift+P`
    2.  Type `Python: Select Interpreter` and press Enter.
    3.  A list of available interpreters will appear. Select the one that corresponds to your project's virtual environment (e.g., `./.venv/bin/python`).

### 5. Verify the Environment in VS Code's Terminal

To be sure you're using the correct environment within VS Code, open a new integrated terminal.

*   Go to **Terminal > New Terminal** in the VS Code menu.
*   By default, VS Code should automatically activate the selected environment in the new terminal session. You should see the `(.venv)` prefix in the terminal prompt within VS Code.

Now, any packages you install using `pip` in this terminal will be installed into your project's isolated virtual environment, not your system's global Python installation.

For example:
```bash
pip install numpy
```

This will install the NumPy package only within your `.venv` environment, keeping your projects and their dependencies neatly separated.
